OSCI: Ontology for Stem Cell Investigations

This is an ontology focused on stem-cell specific (ES and iPS) information for laboratory investigations; needed components, types of cells, line repository, etc. See publication here - https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2723-7


OSCI is a biomedical ontology in the area of stem cell investigations. OSCI imports existing ontologies such as CL, CLO, and OBI, and aims to support standardized stem cell representation, integration, and analysis.

OSCI was initiated from the discussion in the Stem Cell and Cell Line Ontology workshop: https://sites.google.com/site/stemcellow/, which was supported by a LINCS external grant.
