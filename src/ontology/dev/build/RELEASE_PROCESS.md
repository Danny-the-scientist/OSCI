## REALEASE PROCESS:
The release process for the OSCI uses the ROBOT tool produce the osci.owl file.

Information about downloading and installing ROBOT is found at:
- http://robot.obolibrary.org/
- https://github.com/ontodev/robot

To release a version of the OSCI:
- remove an existing owl files from the build directory, e.g.: `rm *.owl` 
- run the `robot_release.sh` command

This will copy the osci-dev.owl file and the imports into build directory, and produce the files:

- osci-merged.owl
- osci-annotated.owl
- osci.owl

The osci.owl is the release file. Open it and check that the ontology IRI was produced correctly and that are not any errors.
The osci-merged.owl and osci-annotated.owl are intermediary files produced in the release process. They can help track down erros.

Finally, when you are satisfied with the ontology generated by the release script:

- copy the build osci.owl file to the ontology directory
- commit and push your changes:
```
git commit -am "create OCSI release $(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')"
git push
```
- tag the repo with the date and time and push the tag: 
```
git tag release_`date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'` -m "OSCI REALEASE $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
git push origin --tags
```
