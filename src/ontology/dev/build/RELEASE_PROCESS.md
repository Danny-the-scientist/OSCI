## REALEASE PROCESS:
The release process for the OSCI ontology uses the ROBOT tool produce the `osci.owl` file.

Information about downloading and installing ROBOT is found at:
- http://robot.obolibrary.org/
- https://github.com/ontodev/robot

Since the robot.jar file is in the directory, calls to robot are made using the `java -jar ./robot.jar` command.
Alternatively, if your system is configured properly, you can edit the script to call robot directly. 
For example, if the path to robot is in your `PATH` environment variable, you can replace `java -jar ./robot.jar` with `robot`.

## RUNNING THE RELEASE SCRIPT
To release a version of the OSCI run the `robot_release.sh` command

This will copy the `osci-dev.owl` file and the imports into build directory, and produce the files:

- `osci-merged.owl`
- `osci-annotated.owl`
- `osci.owl`

The `osci.owl` is the **release file**. Open `osci.owl` and check that the ontology IRI was produced correctly and that are not any errors.
The `osci-merged.owl` and `osci-annotated.owl` are intermediary files produced in the release process.
They are deleted after the build process completes, but they can be helpful in tracking down errors. 
To prevent them from being deleted, comment out the following lines in the build script:
```
rm osci-merged.owl
rm osci-annotated.owl
```

Finally, when you are satisfied with the ontology generated by the release script:

- copy the build `osci.owl` file to the ontology directory
- commit and push your changes:
```
git commit -am "create OSCI release $(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')"
git push
```
- tag the repo with the date and time and push the tag: 
```
git tag OSCI_release_$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H_%M_%S') -m "OSCI REALEASE $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
git push origin --tags
```
